# ToDoList
This is a ToDo list prorgam. At the beginning, I tried to follow this video on youtube [Building a Todo List App with MERN Stack | Todo Application using MongoDB + Express + React + Node
](https://youtu.be/BqRWK57dwqo?si=8XXTNi2Hbpa6N4Rv) Then this will be developed to have additional features.

## Technologies (MERN):
1. Mongo
2. Express
3. React
4. Node js

## Implementation 
To run the program the following instructions are required:
- Frontend side (1st terminal)
```
cd todolist
npm install
npm run dev
```


- Backend side (2nd terminal)
```
cd Server
npm install
npm start
```
